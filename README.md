## mkdocs

This website is based on mkdocs [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/)
(I tried all the others but this one is the simplest - you only need two files!)

## Running

Just install mkdocs with `python -m pip install mkdocs` and then run with
`python -m mkdocs serve`

## Building

Again just `python -m mkdocs build`
